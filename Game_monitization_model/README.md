We need to propose a model for monetization of a game application.

Many games earn money through advertising. And they all face a contradiction:

- The user will get angry and leave if you start showing him ads before the game pulls him in.
- But the later the creators of the game turn on advertising, the less they will earn.

The creators of the game plan to show it on the screen by choosing a building. We will help them not to go into the minus.
