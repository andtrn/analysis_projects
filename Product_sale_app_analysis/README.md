A startup that sells food products. We need to understand how the users of the mobile application behave.

Let's study the sales funnel. We will find out how users reach the purchase.

The designers wanted to change the fonts in the entire application, 
and the managers were afraid that it would be unusual for users. 
We agreed to make a decision based on the results of the A/A/B test. 
The users were divided into 3 groups: 2 control ones with old fonts and one experimental one with new ones. 
Let's find out which font is better.
