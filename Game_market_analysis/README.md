"Streamchik" is an online store that sells computer games all over the world.
We need to identify the patterns that determine the success of the game. 
This will allow us to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.
We have data from 2016.
Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) 
are available from open sources.
